### Hi, I'm Florencia 👋👩🏼‍💻
I'm a Full Stack Developer, recently graduated from the Henry bootcamp.

During the bootcamp, I gained skills and learned different programming languages. In the final stage of the program, I was assigned a web project to develop using an API. Finally, in the final group project, my classmates and I developed a mobile app of our choice using the SCRUM methodology. Through this experience, I learned about teamwork, new tools, and new programming languages outside of the bootcamp curriculum.
